# Product Principles — Authoritative Baseline

Effective date: 2026-09-25

This document is the top-level product-governance reference. New requirements, architecture changes, calculations, workflows and client features must be checked against these principles before implementation.

## Principle 1 — Primavera P6 + PMBOK alignment

For every capability that overlaps Primavera P6 scheduling/project-controls behavior, P6 semantics are the compatibility baseline and must be explicitly documented, implemented in the Shared Domain/Calculation Core and regression-tested.

PMI's PMBOK Guide — Eighth Edition (November 2025), together with ANSI/PMI 99-001-2025, is the project-management framework baseline for governance, value, scope, schedule, finance, stakeholders, resources, risk, procurement and adaptive tailoring. PMBOK is guidance, not a replacement for product-specific scheduling semantics.

No client, API adapter, external package or AI agent may silently redefine P6/shared calculation semantics.

## Principle 2 — Complete, current Construction Management + Project Controls platform

After compliance with Principle 1, the product must continuously cover the real operational lifecycle of modern construction: preconstruction, estimating, procurement, contracting, planning, field execution, quality, safety, progress, project controls, risk, claims, commercial control, closeout and portfolio management.

This principle exists because the market is moving beyond isolated scheduling toward integrated construction operating systems and AI-native project-control platforms.

### Required product layers

1. Preconstruction: estimate, 2D/3D takeoff, tender/bid, bid comparison, prequalification.
2. Planning and controls: WBS, activities, CPM/P6, baselines, scenarios, risk, EVM, earned schedule, resource/cost control.
3. Procurement and commercial: RFQ, supplier quotations, PO, commitments, delivery, required-on-site dates, invoices and commercial status.
4. Field operations: daily logs, labor/timecards, equipment, observations, issues, inspections, quality, safety, punch list, corrective actions, photos and location.
5. Contract/change/claims: contracts, notices, variations/change orders, entitlement, delay analysis, claims, evidence and approvals.
6. Documents and information: drawings, specifications, correspondence, RFI, Submittal, revisions, OCR, search, approvals, immutable issued records and audit trail.
7. BIM/CDE/4D/5D: model/document coordination and links from model objects to WBS/activity/resource/cost where applicable.
8. Reality/progress intelligence: photo/360/drone/model-assisted progress verification and planned-vs-actual evidence.
9. Portfolio/executive control: project and portfolio control rooms covering schedule, cost, progress, risk, procurement, change, contracts and forecast.
10. AI-native assistance: explainable analysis, natural-language queries, document intelligence, schedule scenarios, anomaly detection, recommendations, action proposals, voice input and auditable agent execution.
11. Completion and handover: commissioning, punch closeout, as-built, O&M, warranties and asset handover.
12. Enterprise integration: API, ERP/accounting, BI/data warehouse, identity, e-signature and external collaboration.

### Architectural rule
The scope above does not permit client-specific business-calculation engines. Scheduling/P6, calendar, duration, progress/EVM, resource/cost and financial semantics remain owned by the Shared Domain/Calculation Core.

## Principle 3 — One project truth

Schedule, progress, cost, resource, document, contract, procurement, field and risk records must be linkable through stable project identifiers and revision-aware relationships.

## Principle 4 — Offline-first parity

Web, Desktop and Mobile are first-class clients. Offline-supported workflows must use the same contracts and Shared Core semantics. Synchronization, conflict resolution, idempotency and revision behavior are explicit platform contracts.

## Principle 5 — Reuse infrastructure, not product intelligence

Open-source components may be used for commodity infrastructure, document processing, UI foundations, storage, search or validation when license, security, architecture and long-term maintenance are acceptable.

External libraries must not become an ungoverned second source of truth for P6 scheduling, duration, calendar, Progress/EVM, Resource/Cost or financial semantics.

## Principle 6 — AI must be accountable

AI results that influence project decisions must expose source context where available, distinguish facts from predictions, record the model/action context, preserve human approval for consequential changes and never silently mutate authoritative project data.

## Principle 7 — Typed interoperability

Dates, durations, decimals, currencies, quantities, IDs, versions, revisions and statuses must be represented as typed contracts. Excel, Project, API and offline packages must preserve calculation-ready types.

## Decision gate

Every new feature is classified as:
- P6/PMBOK baseline behavior,
- modern construction completeness,
- shared platform infrastructure,
- client presentation/integration,
- AI intelligence, or
- external validation/reuse.

Conflicts are resolved in this order:
1. Explicit P6 compatibility requirement for overlapping behavior.
2. Shared Core/domain integrity.
3. PMBOK/project-governance alignment.
4. Construction lifecycle completeness.
5. Cross-client parity and portability.
6. User experience and implementation convenience.

## Current market benchmark

The 2026 competitive review considered Oracle Primavera Cloud/P6, Procore, InEight, Autodesk Construction Cloud/Forma, Bentley SYNCHRO, nPlan, ALICE, Planera, Pillar, MeltPlan, Jet.Build, Anyset AI, Mastt, Nodes & Links, Trunk Tools, OpenSpace, Buildots and Document Crunch.

This is a product-governance benchmark, not a claim that every listed vendor implements every capability.
